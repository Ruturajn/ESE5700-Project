This repository contains the project report and related *Cadence Files* of our final project for the course ESE5700 (Digital Integrated Circuits and VLSI Fundamentals) 
at University of Pennsylvania. We have designed a Configurable Logic Block (from circuit schematics to layout), that contains the following elements:

- Two phase clock generator circuit
- D Flip Flop
- Serial In Parallel Out Register
- 6T SRAM
- SRAM Array
- 16:1 Mux
